# Secure Messaging

software is free speech, [lobbyin](https://x.com/SimpleXChat/status/1808068417162805302)[g](https://simplex.chat/blog/20240704-future-of-privacy-enforcing-privacy-standards.html) for privacy is what it takes it seems.

so it was nostr after all?

xmpp or matrix? not [really](https://web.archive.org/web/20211215132539/https://infosec-handbook.eu/articles/xmpp-aitm/). but [signal](https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/) maybe, but how to do tg topics & groups?

HOW does even signal EARNS?? How will [SimplexCha](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/blob/stable/docs/SIMPLEX.md#users-own-simplex-network)[t](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/stable/protocol/overview-tjr.md#threat-model) earn??? <I don't endorse or like simplexChat rn but may change in the future>

signal was given a 50$ mil loan by [Brian Acton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Foundation#Signal_Messenger_LLC) for some reason.

donations from ppl because "its bankrupting", recent desktop bug fiasco shown that its not!

Simplex plan to make a "stamp" (not a coin), users will be able to donate to 3rd party hosters wirh legally binding / build verifiable directly.

## XMPP?

> **TL;DR**

> * Server-side parties (e.g., administrators, attackers, law enforcement) can transparently modify, log, and monitor nearly everything when communicating via XMPP---independent of end-to-end encryption. "Transparently" means your XMPP client doesn't learn about these server-side actions; showing no warnings in most cases.
> * Contrary to claims, law enforcement can easily detect and block XMPP traffic. Furthermore, many XMPP servers are physically centralized, hosted by a small number of hosting companies.
> * Federation, decentralization, encryption, and "use Tor" don't solve these issues as XMPP processes data in cleartext and produces tons of metadata.

## Matrix?

## XMPP?

I feel pgp >> s/meme or [omemo](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html)

pgp relies on curcle of trust, And I think that's what we should rely on.

**session??**

![Wahahah](/images/hah.gif)

adding a coin to a messaging protocol is a joke + lokinet is a joke.

## TG groups but e2ee?

matrix spaces come close, there is a discord open source alternative but feels dubious.
