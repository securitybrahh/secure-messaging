## Matrix?

Matrix linked Amdocs found tapping South African cell phones - https://archive.ph/iFJ0n

Matrix Metadata Leaks? - https://web.archive.org/web/20210202175947/https://serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix

## XMPP?

I feel pgp >> s/meme or [omemo](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html)

pgp relies on curcle of trust, And I think that's what we should rely on.

## TG groups but e2ee?

matrix spaces come close, there is a discord open source alternative but feels dubious.
